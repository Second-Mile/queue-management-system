##Accessing the Queue
1. Go to the Google Drive
2. If necessary, log in using the credentials above
3. Open the file called "Second Mile Queue"

##Signing a Neighbor In
1. When a neighbor walks-in, greet them and ask them if they've been here before.
	Their answer will indicate which form they will need to fill out.
2. Once the form is filled out, an email will be sent to the Second Mile Queue Gmail. 
	The responses will then be imported into the spreadsheet and displayed in the Lobby
	and Lobby Diplay tabs. Receptionists only need to worry about the Lobby and Send SMS tabs.
3. If a Neighbor has indicated that they would like to opt-in to the text messaging service:
	- Ensure that their number is a U.S. number (10-digits)
	- They will automatically pop-up in the Send SMS tab
4. Once a Neighbor is ready to be seen, you can either verbally call them, or if the Neighbor opted in
	to the messaging service:
	- Click the checkbox under the Send Message column
	- Click the "Send Message" button once you have selected the people you would like
	to send a message to. The messages are pre-generated in column E so there is no need to
	type a message in.
5. In the Lobby tab, locate the drop-down menu next to the Neighbor's name. Select the Counselor
	to send the Neighbor to.
6. Once the receptionist sends the Neighbor to the proper counselor, the Neighbor's data will
	automatically move to the Counselor's tab.
7. When a counselor is finished with a Neighbor, the counselor can decide to send the Neighbor
	to the other counselor. If the Neighbor needs to be signed into the Lobby again,
	the counselor will have to select "Sign Out" under the "Action" column
8. At the end of the day, copy any data you'd like to keep. Then click the "Clear Day" button in the 
	Lobby tab.
